Friendscube a opensource social network site (SNS) under development to be used as a training material to learn mixing: GWT, JBoss Errai, Google App Engine (GAE) and Restlet  to build something amazing for the web.

## Running

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dotweblabs/friendscube.git
$ cd friendscube
$ mvn appengine:devserver -Pgae
```

## Motivation

We want friendscube to be a training material to learn building apps using GWT, JBoss Errai and Restlet which runs on the App Engine platform, portable that it can run on the Google Cloud, Appscale and CapeDwarf. We hope that it can be used for talks with the same tech stack that this application is built.

## What works

Nothing really works right now, except for the login and basic posting of 'status.' We need your help to make Friendscube a viable training app that will showcase a complete SNS build with Java. 

## Helping

Clone it, run it, you can help by fixing bugs and making functionalities work or by submitting a bug.
